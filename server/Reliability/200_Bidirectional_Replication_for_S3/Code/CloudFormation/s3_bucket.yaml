  NamingPrefix:
    Type: String
    Description: The naming prefix for resources created by this template including S3 buckets (minimum 5 characters)
    AllowedPattern: '(?=^.{5,40}$)(?!^(\d+\.)+\d+$)(^(([a-z0-9]|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-]*[a-z0-9])\.)*([a-z0-9]|[a-z0-9][a-z0-9\-]*[a-z0-9])$)'
    ConstraintDescription: minimum 5 characters; must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, periods (.), and dashes (-)
