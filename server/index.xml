Introduction Now that you have your CID dashboards setup, you may want to view or group some of the visuals by tag. Common use cases include seeing spend by application, identifying opportunity by cost category, or building charge-back mechanisms to business units.
If you have cost allocation tags or cost categories setup in your AWS account, you will see those tags in your CUR. They show up as their own column.</description></item><item><title>Filtering Visuals by Cost Allocation Tags</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cloud_intelligence/customizations/guides/2_addingcontrols/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2021 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cloud_intelligence/customizations/guides/2_addingcontrols/</guid><description>Last Updated March 2022

Introduction From time to time, customers will have concerns such as: ‘my AWS bills are going up and I don’t know whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing’. Did the bill go up because they are operating more workloads in the cloud, or is it because they are using AWS inefficiently? … Perhaps, a little bit of both. Regardless of the reason, the most often encountered interpretation is that more spend is bad.</description></item><item><title>Configure Services</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cost_journey/1_configure_services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Mar 2021 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cost_journey/1_configure_services/</guid><description>Create S3 Bucket Create a single S3 bucket that will contain the journey files for all workloads in that account.

Backing up data frequently is of vital importance for the long lasting success of any organization. However, a backup of data is only valuable if data can be recovered/restored from the backup. In the cloud, backing up data and testing the restore is easier compared to on-premises datacenters. Automating this process with appropriate notification systems will ensure that an organization&amp;rsquo;s data is backed up frequently, the backups are tested to ensure expected recovery, and appropriate people are notified in case of failures.</description></item><item><title>Create Pricing Data Sources</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_pricing_model_analysis/1_pricing_sources/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_pricing_model_analysis/1_pricing_sources/</guid><description>Option 1: Manual Deployment Click here to continue with the manual Setup Create S3 Bucket and Folders Create a single S3 bucket that contains two folders - od_pricedata and sp_pricedata, these will contain the on-demand pricing data and the Savings Plans pricing data.

For example, if your CUR table is called cur_table and is in a database called cur_db, you would replace ${table_name} with cur_db.</description></item><item><title>Create Cost Intelligence Dashboard</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_enterprise_dashboards/1_create_cost_intelligence/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_enterprise_dashboards/1_create_cost_intelligence/</guid><description>This Lab has moved under the Level 200 Cloud Intelligence Dashboards.Click this link to navigate to the updated Lab Authors Alee Whitman, Commercial Architect (AWS OPTICS) Contributors Arun Santhosh, Specialist SA (Amazon QuickSight) Kareem Syed-Mohammed, Senior Product Manager - Technical (Amazon QuickSight) Aaron Edell, Global Head of Business and GTM - EC2 Insights Timur Tulyaganov, AWS Technical Account Manager Yuriy Prykhodko, AWS Technical Account Manager FAQ The FAQ with the added Visual by Visual breakdown for this dashboard is here.</description></item><item><title>Prerequisites</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cloud_intelligence/compute-optimizer-dashboards/dashboards/1_prerequisites/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cloud_intelligence/compute-optimizer-dashboards/dashboards/1_prerequisites/</guid><description>1/4 Enable AWS Compute Optimizer To get right sizing recommendations you need to Enroll all accounts to Compute Optmizer .

How do you implement change?
Best practice: Deploy changes with automation: Deployments and patching are automated to eliminate negative impact. Design principle: Manage change in automation: Changes to your infrastructure should be made using automation. The changes that need to be managed include changes to the automation, which then can be tracked and reviewed. When this lab is completed, you will have deployed and edited a CloudFormation template.</description></item><item><title>Deploy the CloudFormation Stack</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/200_labs/200_remote_configuration_installation_and_viewing_cloudwatch_logs/1_deploy_cfn_stack/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/200_labs/200_remote_configuration_installation_and_viewing_cloudwatch_logs/1_deploy_cfn_stack/</guid><description>This portion of the lab shows you how to deploy an EC2 instance using a CloudFormation template.

You can define your entire workload (applications, infrastructure, etc.) as code and update it with code. You can script your operations procedures and automate their execution by triggering them in response to events. By performing operations as code, you limit human error and enable consistent execution of operations activities.

It’s also the process of looking at deployed instances and identifying opportunities to eliminate or downsize without compromising capacity or other requirements, which results in lower costs.
Rightsizing is an ongoing process and it&amp;rsquo;s the most effective way to control cloud costs. It involves continually analyzing instance performance and usage needs and patterns—and then turning off idle instances and rightsizing instances that are either overprovisioned or poorly matched to the workload.</description></item><item><title>Launch Instance</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/200_labs/200_basic_ec2_with_waf_protection/1_launch_instance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/200_labs/200_basic_ec2_with_waf_protection/1_launch_instance/</guid><description>For launching your first instance, we are going to use the launch wizard in the Amazon EC2 console.

A workload identifies a set of components that deliver business value. The workload is usually the level of detail that business and technology leaders communicate about. Workloads vary in levels of architectural complexity, from static websites to architectures with multiple data stores and many components.
Creating a workload We will start with creating a Well-Architected workload to use throughout this lab. Using the create-workload API , you can create a new Well-Architected workload: aws wellarchitected create-workload --workload-name &amp;#34;WA Lab Test Workload&amp;#34; --description &amp;#34;Test Workload for WA Lab&amp;#34; --review-owner &amp;#34;John Smith&amp;#34; --environment &amp;#34;PRODUCTION&amp;#34; --aws-regions &amp;#34;us-east-1&amp;#34; --lenses &amp;#34;wellarchitected&amp;#34; &amp;#34;serverless&amp;#34; The following are the required parameters for the command: workload-name - This is a uniquie identifier for the workload.</description></item><item><title>Scope of Impact of failures</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/2_impact_of_failures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/2_impact_of_failures/</guid><description>Break the application In the scenario used in the lab, the application has a known issue which is triggered by passing a &amp;ldquo;bad&amp;rdquo; query string.

A dedicated member account will be created for the Cost Optimization team or function, and another (or multiple) member account/s created to contain workload resources.</description></item><item><title>Create an IAM Policy to restrict service usage by region</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_2_cost_and_usage_governance/2_ec2_restrict_region/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_2_cost_and_usage_governance/2_ec2_restrict_region/</guid><description>To manage costs you need to manage and control your usage. AWS offers multiple regions, so depending on your business requirements you can limit access to AWS services depending on the region. This can be used to ensure usage is only allowed in specific regions which are more cost effective, and minimize associated usage and cost, such as data transfer.
We will create a policy that allows all EC2, RDS and S3 access in a single region only.</description></item><item><title>Create an IAM Role to use with Amazon CloudWatch Agent</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_aws_resource_optimization/2_create_iamrole/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_aws_resource_optimization/2_create_iamrole/</guid><description>Access to AWS resources requires permissions.

How do you meet cost targets when you select resource type, size and number. Defining a workload generates an event called CreateWorkload that Amazon EventBridge receives, which will invoke AWS Lambda function that collects cost optimization data from AWS Compute Optimizer and AWS Trusted Advisor. Then this data will be automatically available before the review, reviewer and customer could have a data-driven cost optimization review.</description></item><item><title>Saving a milestone</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/well-architectedtool/200_labs/200_using_awscli_to_manage_wa_reviews/4_save_milestone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/well-architectedtool/200_labs/200_using_awscli_to_manage_wa_reviews/4_save_milestone/</guid><description>Overview A milestone records the state of a workload at a particular point in time.
Save a milestone after you initially complete all the questions associated with a workload. As you change your workload based on items in your improvement plan, you can save additional milestones to measure progress.
A best practice is to save a milestone when you first do a new W-A review, or every time you make improvements to a workload.</description></item><item><title>Impact of failures with sharding</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/4_impact_of_failures_sharding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/4_impact_of_failures_sharding/</guid><description>Break the application You will now introduce the poison pill into the workload by including the bug query-string with your requests and see how the updated workload architecture handles it.

The report contains your responses to the workload questions, your notes, and the current number of high and medium risks identified.
1. Gather pillar and risk data for a workload Using the get-lens-review API , you can retrieve the pillar review summaries for the workload: aws wellarchitected get-lens-review --workload-id &amp;#34;&amp;lt;WorkloadId&amp;gt;&amp;#34; --lens-alias &amp;#34;wellarchitected&amp;#34; This will return a summary of the workload review summaries for each pillar.</description></item><item><title>Implement shuffle sharding</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/5_implement_shuffle_sharding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 11:16:09 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/300_labs/300_fault_isolation_with_shuffle_sharding/5_implement_shuffle_sharding/</guid><description>In this section you will update the architectural design of the workload and implement shuffle sharding. Shuffle sharding is a combinatorial implementation of a sharded architecture. With shuffle sharding you create virtual shards with a subset of the capacity of the workload ensuring that the virtual shards are mapped to a unique subset of customers with no overlap. By minimizing the number of Workers a single customer is able to interact with within the workload, and spreading resources in a combinatorial way, you will be able to further reduce the impact of a potential posion pill.</description></item><item><title>Generate CPU and Memory load</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/5_generating_load/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2020 11:16:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/performance-efficiency/100_labs/100_monitoring_linux_ec2_cloudwatch/5_generating_load/</guid><description>We have a CloudWatch dashboard to show us CPU and Memory statistics for the deployed EC2 instance.

Ingest Our data source is streaming data coming from external applications. We present a Global Accelerator endpoint for the producers to send data to. The endpoint is serviced in a particular region by a Lambda function behind an Application Load Balancer. The Lambda function relays the data to a Kinesis stream.
Batch Processing Once the data lands in a Kinesis stream, the batch processing flow picks up with a Firehose landing the data in S3.</description></item><item><title>Endpoint Switch</title><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_backup_restore_failback_analytics/failover/endpoint/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 10:02:27 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/reliability/200_labs/200_backup_restore_failback_analytics/failover/endpoint/</guid><description>Switching the endpoint Now we&amp;rsquo;re ready to reconfigure the Global Accelerator endpoint.

It is triggered by an S3 Event, reads the folder from the object - and then applies the required object ACL: FULL_CONTROL for the owner, READ for the sub account.
Edit the following fields in the code below:
folder1: The name of the folder where new files will be placed Owner Account Name: The owner account name - the account email without the @companyname, they will get FULL_CONTROL permissions Owner Canonical ID: The owner canonical ID, to get the Canonical ID, refer to: https://docs.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/300_labs/300_splitting_sharing_cur_access/code/sub_account_split/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/300_labs/300_splitting_sharing_cur_access/code/sub_account_split/</guid><description>Below is the code for the lambda function.
You will need to modify the following variable:
athena_output: This is where Athena puts output data, this is typically the management/payer Account ID, which is the default folder for Athena output queries bucketname: This is the output bucket for the Athena queries You will need to modify the following arrays, the order is important - the first folder in the subfolder array, will be given the permissions of the first element of the S3ObjectPolicies array.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/300_labs/300_splitting_sharing_cur_access/code/subacctsplit_role/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/300_labs/300_splitting_sharing_cur_access/code/subacctsplit_role/</guid><description>Review the policy below, and use it as a starting point to create your policy for the Lambda fuction.
