We’ve broken the workshop down into easy to follow and digestible chunks, which walks you through the process of recovery from a disaster using a variety of AWS services.

In **Module 1**, we will deploy the Unishop in one AWS regions and then utilize AWS Backup and EC2 AMIs to create a backup of our shop in another AWS region. We will demonstrate DR by simulating a disaster in the primary region and recovering the shop in the backup region. This module takes about 90 minutes to complete.

In **Module 2**, we will demonstrate DR using a pilot light architecture and in **Module 3** we will use a warm standby. This module takes about 60 minutes to complete.

In **Module 4** we will deploy the shop in an Active-Active configuration thus ensuring minimal RTO\RPO. This module takes about 60 minutes to complete.

Finally, **Module 5** introduces CloudEndure which is a DR as a Service offering from AWS. This module takes about 60 minutes to complete.

As you probably understand by now, one of the major benefits cloud architecture is range of options available for DR and the ease with which they can be implemented.
