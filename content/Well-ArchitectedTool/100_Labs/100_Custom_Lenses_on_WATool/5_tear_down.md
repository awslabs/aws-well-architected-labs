In order to take down the lab environment, you simply delete the workload and the custom lense you created.

To delete the **Workload**, please refer to [Here](../../../100_labs/100_walkthrough_of_the_well-architected_tool/6_tear_down/). Please be aware if the custom lens has already been used by a workload review, it cannot be deleted until the workload review has been deleted first. 

1. Select **Custom Lenses** on the left navigation:

2. Select the radio button next to the **Custom lense we created** and then click the **Delete** button.
