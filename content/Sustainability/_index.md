## Introduction
Environmental sustainability is a shared responsibility between customers and AWS. AWS is responsible for sustainability **of** the cloud; delivering efficient, shared infrastructure, water stewardship and sourcing renewable power. Customers are responsible for sustainability **in** the cloud, optimizing workloads and resource utilization.
