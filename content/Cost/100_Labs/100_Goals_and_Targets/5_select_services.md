## Service Selection

### Evaluate Cost
#### Licensing
 - **Goal**: Reduce database licensing costs
 - **Target**: Within 1 year, convert 10 workloads with VendorX databases to Open Source databases
 - **Best Practice**: [Licensing Costs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/evaluate-cost-when-selecting-services.html)
  - **Measures**: Number of workloads converted
 - **Good/Bad**: Good
 - **Why? When does it work well or not?**: Works well to reduce licensing costs, significant effort in conversion may reduce overall savings.
